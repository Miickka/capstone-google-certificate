# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

### Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I am a junior data analyst working for a fictional company, Cyclistic, based in Chicago (USA). I was assigned with the question to answer: *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*

After downloading [the previous 12 months of data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), I merged everything into a single .csv file containing more than **6 million rows**. In order to answer the business question, I've followed the data analysis process: *Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act*. I am working with using **Pandas (Python)** 

I had to produce a report with the following deliverables:

1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis
