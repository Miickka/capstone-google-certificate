# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

### Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I am a junior data analyst working for a fictional company, Cyclistic, based in Chicago (USA). I was assigned with the question to answer: *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*

After downloading [the previous 12 months of data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)*, I merged everything into a single .csv file containing more than **6 million rows**. In order to answer the business question, I've followed the data analysis process: *Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act*. I am working with using **Pandas (Python)** 

I had to produce a report with the following deliverables:

1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis

*(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).) This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues
prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
